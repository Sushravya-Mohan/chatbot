# Customer Support Chatbot

This project is a production-level implementation of a customer support chatbot. It uses a Transformer-based model with scaled dot-product attention built in PyTorch, simulates historical conversations and FAQs for context retrieval using TF-IDF (scikit-learn), and provides a REST API with FastAPI. The project is containerized with Docker for scalable deployment.
